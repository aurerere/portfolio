### Pitch

---
A friend organizing a concert wanted to find a solution for the audience to vote on the proposed merchandise.
So, I came up with a system of unique QR codes *(in the form of plexiglass plaques)* that would not only allow voting
but also provide each spectator with a souvenir, a potential entry key to a future event,
and access to a web application where exclusive tracks are made available.

At the same time, I was tasked with creating the visual identity of the production company.
