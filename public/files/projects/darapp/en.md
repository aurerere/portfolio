A friend organizing a concert wanted to find a solution for the audience to vote on the proposed merchandise.
So, I came up with a system of unique QR codes (in the form of plexiglass plaques) that would not only allow voting but
also provide each spectator with a souvenir, a potential entry key to a future event, and access to a web application
where exclusive tracks are made available.

At the same time, I was tasked with creating the visual identity of the production company.
