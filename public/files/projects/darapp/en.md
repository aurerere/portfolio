### Pitch

---
A friend organizing a concert wanted to find a solution to get the public to vote on different merchandising design
hypotheses. I therefore imagined a system of unique QR codes _(in the form of plexiglass plates)_ which would allow,
in addition to voting, to give each spectator a souvenir, a possible entry key for a future event, and access
to a web application where exclusive tracks are available to them.

At the same time, I was tasked with creating the visual identity of the production company.
