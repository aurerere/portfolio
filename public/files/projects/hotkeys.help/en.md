### Pitch

---

For a year-end project in Computer Science and Digital Sciences (NSI) in high school, a friend of mine and I developed a
collaborative website that compiles software along with keyboard shortcuts and associated usage tips.

Truly committed to the project, I continued working on it in my free time,
enhancing it with my newly acquired knowledge.

It was gratifying to have the sense of developing a useful tool.

> I have not had the opportunity to finalize a new version, but I have learned a lot at this occasion. 
It is not ruled out that I may revisit it, refining the concept for improvement.
