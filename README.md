## Credits

---

- To [null-dev](https://github.com/null-dev) for the CSS preprocess - which allows to use `@import` while still limiting 
  the scope of the stylesheet to the component context.
  _(The script was uploaded [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/7125))_
- To [Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed) for the idea of the effect on project cards and the explanation 
  of its implementation _(I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htGfnF1zN4g))_
